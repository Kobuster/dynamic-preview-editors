Preview your links in your sidebar, the hover editor, or native preview based on their type. This is a fork of [Hover Editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor) designed for more efficient reference viewing and (as close as exists) inline editing of embeds.

## Features

### Choose Preview Modes by Link Format
Choose exactly how each link type is previewed:
- **Standard** - Regular links
- **Footnotes** (`[^1]`) - Native preview, floating editor, or sidebar
- **Headings** (`#Section`) - Navigate to specific sections instantly
- **Block references** (`#^blockid`) - Jump to precise locations
- **Embeds** (`![[note]]`, `![[image.png]]`) - Edit embedded content almost inline

### NEW: Sidebar Mode
Edit embedded notes and references **without leaving your current view** or pushing around popovers. The sidebar is now a secondary editing workspace - perfect for:
-  **Quick edits** while keeping your main note in focus
-  **Easier comparing of notes** side-by-side
- **Preview history** Navigate between viewed previews like a regular note pane
- (near) **seemless editing of embedded content**

Previews are not persistent and quickly accessible or hideable in your left or right sidebar


### Flexible Configuration
- **Per-link-type modes** - Footnotes in sidebar, headings floating, blocks native
- **Sidebar position** - Left or right, your choice
- **Auto-focus control** - Reveal sidebar without stealing focus
- **Trigger delay** - Fine-tune responsiveness

### Floating Hover Editor (Original Features)
All the power of Hover Editor remains:
- Resizable, draggable preview windows
- Pin multiple previews for reference
- Full editing capabilities in hover views
- Snap to screen edges
- Image zoom support

HUGE THANKS TO **NothingisLost** for making Hover Editor!

## Use Cases

### Research & Writing
Hover over citations while drafting → sidebar opens the source → edit notes inline → continue writing without context switching.

### Knowledge Base Management
Preview and edit linked notes instantly. Perfect for maintaining a web of interconnected ideas without losing your place.

### Embedded Content Workflow
Embed a note block → hover it → edit in sidebar → changes sync immediately. Near-inline editing with full editor features.
